## Antonia Cronin

Hi, I'm a Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and PHP junior full-stack developer with a love of Agile and TDD. A recent graduate of __Makers Academy__, I have also worked in commercial, Government and freelance positions.  

I am looking for a web or software position where I can contribute to Agile teams, continue to learn new technologies and test-drive development.
